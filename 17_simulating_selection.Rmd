# (PART) Interactive Simulations  {.unnumbered}

# Simulating Selection {-}

This app allows you to simulate the effects of natural selection on the frequency of an allele *A* (*p*). Critical parameters include:

-   The starting allele frequency, *p*0. This parameter can vary between 0 and 1.

-   The number of generations you want to run the simulation for (maximum: 1000).

-   The relative fitness of each genotype (*AA*, *Aa*, and *aa*). Fitness values can vary between 0 and 2.

Try to play with different scenarios. Change one parameter at a time to explore how outcomes vary.
