# Simulating Mutation and Selection {-}

This app allows you to simulate the combined effects of mutation and natural selection on the frequency of an allele *A* (*p*). Critical parameters include:

-   The starting allele frequency, *p*0. This parameter can vary between 0 and 1.

-   The relative fitness of genotypes *Aa* and *aa* (note that the fitness of *AA* is fixed at 1). Fitness values can vary between 0 and 2.

-   The mutation rate from A to a, which can vary from 0.00001 to 1.

-   The number of generations you want to run the simulation for (maximum: 1000).

Try to play with different scenarios. Change one parameter at a time to explore how outcomes vary.
