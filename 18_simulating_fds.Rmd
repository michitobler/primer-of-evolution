# Simulating Frequency-Dependent Selection {.unnumbered}

This app allows you to simulate negative frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of each genotype is dependent on its frequency in the population. Critical parameters include:

-   The starting allele frequency, *p*0. This parameter can vary between 0 and 1.

-   The number of generations you want to run the simulation for (maximum: 1000).

-   The strength of selection against heterozygotes when they are common, which can vary between 0 and 2.

Try to play with different scenarios. Change one parameter at a time to explore how outcomes vary.
