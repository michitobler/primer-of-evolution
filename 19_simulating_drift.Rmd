# Simulating Genetic Drift {-}

This app allows you to simulate the effects of genetic drift on the frequency of an allele *A* (*p*). Critical parameters include:

-   The starting allele frequency, *p*0. This parameter can vary between 0 and 1.

-   The number of generations you want to run the simulation for (maximum: 1000).

-   The size of the population, which can vary between 2 and 1000.

-   The number of replicate simulations, which can vary between 1 and 50.

Try to play with different scenarios. Change one parameter at a time to explore how outcomes vary. Be careful with simulations that use a high number of generations and replicates, as they can take a long time to run.
